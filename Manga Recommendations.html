         <h1>Manga Recommendation of Berserk</h1>
		 <p>The First Manga I like to Recommend is Berserk. I got into the series through the anime in High School</p>
		<p> The Basic plot of this series is Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world,
		the story centers on the characters of Guts, a lone swordsman, and Griffith, 
		the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band of the Hawk". 
		The series follows Guts' journey seeking revenge on Griffith, 
		who betrayed him and sacrificed his comrades to become a powerful demonic being.</p>
		<p>The Story is very dark and covers a wide range of dark topics like death, sexual assault, violence, etc.</p> 
		 
		 <h3>What's so great about it</h3>
		 <p>The Worldbuilding is ever expanding. The Author does a great job building up
		 and establishing a very brutal and immersive european setting and does not shy away
		 from the more messed aspects of that society. Although he does not show all the locations,
		 there are based in medival europe with Knights, Metal Chad soldiers, Patriarchal Monoarchies, etc.</p>
		 
		 <p>The Story starts off with the blackswords where we explore the prolouge of what the character
		 later becomes and has more of the fantasical elements it becomes known for until it gets to 
		 where it all began with the blackswordsman arc. Golden age Arc is the actual start of the story
		 where it explores all the character relationships and origins that have led to what we see 
		 in blackswordsman and is very straightforward direction of the revenge narrative</p>
		 
		 
		<h3>Characters</h3>
		<p>The Characters are layered and have great interactions with	each other and have their own goals
		The Antagonists have a lot of depth into their plans and how they will execute them and have detailed backstories.
		The Author does a great job on intermigling the characters and explain how they know each 
		other and the complexities of their relationships through carefully woven dialogue and actions.</p>
		
		
		
		
		<h3>Art</h3>
		<p>The Action is very intense and brutal. The Artwork of the series is heavily 
		referenced in a lot of other works like Dark Souls. It is very gore filled and 
		bloody and features a lot of mulitlation and dismemberment. The Double Page Spreads 
		are amazing to look at since the Author took a lot of time to detail them to 
		however he wants reflecting the brutal nature of the story.</p>
		
		<h3>Adaptation</h3>
		
		<p>The Anime Adaptation for the 2016 anime is very lackluster especially with the action.
		One good thing is cutting down a very integral arc of the manga and has a lot of other changes
		that ultimately devalue the story. The 3D Animation is nothing to write home about and does not
		elevate the source material for me and looks really visually jaring with a lot of 2d art
		not mixing well with the 3D animation.</p> 
		
		
		
		<p>
		The Adaptation from 1997 is very faithful in adapting the 
		golden age arc of the manga but the First ep had to adapt the first 3 chaps to establish tone
		and other content changes. The Animation also is dated but is carried by other soundtracks
		and overall art design. The Golden Age Movies from 2012 and Millennium edition from 2023 are 
		a readaptation of the golden age arc that condenses all of the content into 3 movies/ 13 episodes
		and it also cuts a lot of content but also offers some well animated sequences.</p>

		 <h3>2nd Recommendation of Tokyo Ghoul</h3>
		<p>The story is set in an alternate version of Tokyo where humans coexist with ghouls, 
		beings who look like humans but can only survive by eating human flesh.
		Ken Kaneki is a college student who is transformed into a half-ghoul after an
		encounter with one of them. He must navigate the complex social and political dynamics
		between humans and ghouls while struggling to maintain his humanity.</p>
		 
		 <h3> Everything Great about it</h3>
		<p>Just Like Berserk, It is able to tackle a lot of very dark but integral ideas
		 when it comes to humanity, violence, identity, purpose, cannablism, and survival.
		 These Ideas serve as a foundation for the direction of the character arc for the MC.</p>
		 
		  <p>The Worldbuilding is very Intresting. It is very set in reality of Tokyo, Japan
		  that is seperated into 24 wards that is dependent on the type of ghouls that are occupied 
		  in the area. The government forces use ghoul flesh biotech to comabat the other ghouls
		  that have their indivual groups in an attempt for survival and blend into human society.
		</p>
		
		<p>The Story is structured into to 2 parts where there is Tokyo Ghoul and the sequel
		series Tokyo Ghoul Re where the MC becomes a different character and see the perspective
		of the opposing force. For the First part, it is mainly structured to be very character
		center where there are a lot horrific events that happen to the title character
		and the way he reacts to those events shape his worldview and perspective 
		and meets other charcters that explores the life of a ghoul in how they function
		and the different factions that form for survival.</p>
		
		<h3>Art</h3>
		<p>The art style in Tokyo Ghoul perfectly captures the dark and twisted atmosphere of the series.
		The use of shadows, contrasting colors, and intricate linework adds depth 
		and intensity to the visuals, immersing viewers in the haunting world of ghouls and humans.</p>
		
		
		
		<h3>Characters</h3>
		<p>All the Characters get a lot time to shine. The Author explores on both sides of 
		the conflict with the ghouls and the humans that fight them and creates 
		a vital gray morality to its world and makes you the reader question 
		certain choices in terms of right and wrong.</p>
		
		
		
		<h3>Adaptation</h3>
		<p>The Anime Adaptation for the 2015 anime is very faithful in my opinion while others 
		may disagree due to the pace and how much content it tries to adapt 84 chapters in 12eps.
		The Animation quality from Studio Pierrot is the best in the first season with great color
		choices and being as bloody as the broadcasting allows. </p> 
		
		<p>
		The Adaptation in later seasons is not up to the quality due to the Root A season 
		not adapting the Manga Canon. Tokyo Ghoul RE starts following the manga content
		but it makes the overall Adaptation very confusing for Anime only viewers who 
		do not know the manga material and will be alienated from the experience. The
		2nd season of RE rushes throught the remaining material which is 12 vols of 
		manga content.</p>

		 <h3>3rd Recommendation will be Gantz </h3>
		<p>It tells the story of Kei Kurono and Masaru Kato, both of whom died in a train accident 
		 and become part of a semi-posthumous "game" in which they and several other recently deceased 
		 people are forced to hunt down and kill aliens armed with a handful of futuristic items, equipment, and weaponry.</p>
		 
		 <h3> Everything Great about it</h3>
		 <p>The Action is very cinematic in that the action is very easy to read but is very full 
		 of gore. It really escalates to get crazier and crazier along the aliens that continue
		 to grow in scale, numbers, and designs. The Designs ranged from Bird Aliens, Dinosaurs,
		 Vampires, Religious Statues, Giant aliens, etc. Story does a good job of gradually escalting 
		 stakes and rising each threat.</p>
		 
		 <p>The story is structured with the characters being exposed to the Gantz Missions
		 of killing any of the Aliens they are told to kill without knowing how anything 
		 works with the tech weapons they are given or the suits. After the Missions, they go
		 back to their everyday lives as they come to terms with what happen and struggle
		 with the meaning of their own lives after horrific missions and go back to their 
		 terrible lives. The Aliens gradually get more complex in design, abilities, and 
		 overall conciseness as they start off simple looking but eventually get more
		 dangerous as the threat of dying gets close and start to have final forms.
		 There are 3 parts to the story with Main character until he dies, The 2nd part
		 with the side character Kato taking the lead, and the 3rd part being the final invasion
		 of the last alien threat.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3>Art</h3>
		<p>When creating the chapters for the manga, Oku starts with a thumbnail of the pages. 
		He then creates 3D models of the characters and backgrounds on his computer. 
		Once done, Oku prints the characters and backgrounds he made in 3D, adds tone and color to the pages,
		and finishes with sound effects and dialogue.[5] He had already used this style in Zero One, 
		but for that title, there was little work in hand drawing; Oku decided to add more hand drawing 
		to give Gantz a more realistic tone as well as reduce the budget. However, he still notes that 
		such a method is time-consuming and that he has to work quickly in order to finish the chapters on time.</p>
		
		
		
		<h3>Characters</h3>
		
		<p>The Characters is something the author takes a unique approach in that most of the characters
		are very random and get killed off rather quicky and range from people of all walks of life
		which represents that anyone can die and be chosen at random. Some are by design unlikeable
		and may not root for them but that is jump off to give them any redeeming features and 
		develop them further. He keeps you guessing on who will survive.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Adaptation</h3>
		<p>
		The Adaptation from Studio Gonzo in 2004 is Somewhat adapting the first 80 chapters of the Manga
		It makes Content changes that are good like giving a character a lot more depth and humanity
		but also adds in more scenes that certain people could find very gratuitous. The Animation
		is very hit or miss with production where the Actual gore feels very gnarly but the pacing
		drags out a lot of scenes making the action feel very slow. It is also notorious for its original
		ending that adds nothing and does not make any sense in the context of the Adaptation.
		There is the Movie that came out in 2016 that is in Full 3D CG that is very faithful
		in adapting the Osaka Arc in the manga with changes and being a great action film.
